## Introduction
Worked in a group to develop a Python algorithm to form fair teams for a 6,000-student course, ensuring diversity by school, gender, and CGPA. 

- Data Processing: Processed 6,000 student records efficiently and generated clear visualizations using 
  matplotlib to demonstrate team diversity metrics and algorithm effectiveness. 
  
- Algorithm Design: Created a custom team formation algorithm using only Pythonâ€™s built-in data 
  structures (lists/dictionaries), handling edge cases and optimizing for balanced team composition. 

Evaluated team diversity and showcased results with clear visualizations using matplotlib.
